           In the essay “404 Page Not Found” by Kate Wagner she delves into an essay about how capitalism affected the growth of the internet and how the evolution of the internet has affected how we interact with the internet. In this essay, Wagner reflected on her childhood interacting with the internet and getting accustomed to having the internet in her life. Describing on how social media grew along with her through her many years at school helps describe not only the evolution of the internet but also how the internet affected us socially and impacted users. She then follows this by describing how the internet started to acknowledge that it could profit off of the nostalgia that others had with it and she describes how she felt being served her childhood and growing years in an unsavory new form and how unrealistic it was. </p> 
    
    <div>  
        <p>Wagner uses this quote “Capitalism will obliterate everything you know and love” to better describe how she views the internet being ruined by capitalism. Pointing out that as a result of capitalism, the internet isn’t as focused on user experience despite the purpose of the internet being focused on the user. She then adds this quote to solidify her point and introduce her next “… we’ve studied the history of hypertext, but not the history of Metallica fan web rings or web rings in general.” This quote helps show that under the influence of capitalism, the internet has a process of closing down websites or apps with loads of users and not allowing them to deal with the loss. Wagner laments on how the memories the users create on those sites are just lost forever and the users are just meant to go on with their lives and ignore the time spent on the site. </p>

        <p>She then goes into the topic of Geocities and how users once carefully created their pages and curated their online presence just to lose it all without warning. Next, Wagner goes into how as a society users went from creating their internet presences with their pages to where they are now, consuming and “creating” content for others to consume. Continuing how Web 2.0 ruined users' relationship with creating their pages and their internet presence and now the internet is just an experience with very few freedoms. Wagner states “ Users, in other words, must now operate within the hell of beautiful interfaces designed by experts.” This quote fulfills the point she makes by reflecting on the evolution of the internet and how much users have lost from the gains of capitalism while thinking that it’s the high-class freedom they can have. 
Wagner then points out how there’s a class difference between websites and that some are seen as less than because of what school one of the creators came from which somehow reflects on how slick and clean his website looks compared to the freedom users had on Myspace. In a way, it’s a capitalistic propaganda machine to make users believe that less freedom is classier and better. This segues into the new reality of users barely using the internet and are forced into simply downloading their apps to get the best of their interface. The evolution of the internet is harrowing realizing that most of the websites that are linked to apps are completely unusable just so that the user is forced into downloading their app. </p>
        
    </div> 
        <p>Wagner's essay forces the reader to reflect on their experience as users of various interfaces and to look at how capitalism has made our lack of freedom to express ourselves easier and somewhat better for them. The collapse of the many apps that users have fond memories of just evaporated. </p>
