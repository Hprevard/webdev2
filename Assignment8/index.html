		<p>There’s a lot of people who think that astrology isn’t real. ♉️
But it has large roots in our culture as a human species. Astrology is our understanding and connection with the celestial bodies in our universe. The main beliefs of astrology involve the understanding that the positions of the planets and asteroids in our solar system and beyond can influence your personality, and events that happen in your life. Astrology helps us as humans connect to the unknown forces that shape our lives. Astrology has existed for thousands of years long before Christianity, and it has many different forms in different cultures. For example, ancient India practiced Vedic astrology 3000 years ago, there is of course Egyptian astrology where each sign is named after a god or a goddess. But astrology has deep roots in almost every single culture and its origins. Astrology has connections with witchcraft, paganism, astronomy, psychology, and mythology, which attracts many to this day seeking meaning in their lives and guidance. 
  </p>
		<p>But the question comes into play: If astrology wasn’t real then why does it has such a prevalent history lasting longer than most dynasties? The answer is its experiences in its believers who use their intuition, pattern recognition, and self reflection under the proper study of astrology. In todays day and age the belief in astrology is carried by how we understand how the celestial bodies more powerful than us affect us and our daily lives as we struggle to survive in a capitalistic society. Nowadays astrology is used for us to have heavy introspection and personal growth. It reflects the traits, tendencies, patterns and possible future which causes us to have a deeper understanding of not only us as a person but everyone around us.
