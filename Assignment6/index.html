              The Pros of Using AI Art generators
              </h2>
              <h3> By Electra Nanou</h3>
              <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-art-generation-ethical-pros-cons/">The Ethical Pros and Cons of AI Art Generation</a>
     <p>
         1. Anyone can create art with artificial intelligence. </p>
        <p> You just enter a prompt, and the AI generator delivers images to the best of its capabilities. The clearer and more detailed the prompt, the more interesting the results. If nothing else, you don’t have to depend on expensive and time-consuming professionals to get the job done. Leveling the artistic playing field is a significant ethical advantage.</p>

       <p>  2. You don't need to pay a Fortune for Art. 
          </p>
        <p>Another major perk of being able to generate your own designs with AI generators is that they’re mostly free to use. What makes this ethically appealing is that a human artist can charge a lot for a single commission, so if you’re strapped for money or need more artwork than you can afford, a good AI image generator is an asset.
                </p>
        <p> 3. Services Are Starting to Acknowledge and Pay Original Artists
              </p>
        <p>  On the plus side, Shutterstock's ethical AI image generator, created in partnership with OpenAI, sets a positive example by compensating artists whose work the engine uses. 
              </p>
        <p> 4. AI Technology Revives Classic Artistic Styles
              </p>
        <p> One of the most inspiring aspects of AI art generation is that the software can learn from old images and breathe new life into classics. You can ask for Van Gogh or Picasso-themed designs, and the generator will respond accordingly with varied results. The best AI text-to-art generators are those with the most advanced data sets and the ability to accurately interpret prompts, all thanks to their machine learning. These services produce the most impressive images that mimic old styles and, in a way, pay posthumous homage to classic artists that shaped the modern art world.

          <p>
             In the artist world AI has conjured up a huge amount of controversy and for good reason. According to MSN ,” Just a year ago Pixar laid off 75 of their employees and some were with the studios for over 25 years. This was apart of their plan that was fully executed this month”. One of the biggest reasons why AI art is hated is that anyone whether they have any interest in art at all or whether they want to exploit this tool to scam others or to generate a stream of income faking being an artist constantly creating AI art. There is a reason why commissions for art is expensive because art supplies as a whole are generally very expensive and living costs across the country have skyrocketed. 
 
              
              </p>
          
          <p>For artists that spend large amounts of their time to strengthen their skills and spend hours creating their art. Meanwhile someone can just type in words into a ai chat and generate the image. The process within itself drains the entire purpose of making art to begin with. Any effort to glamorize AI art will start the beginning of the end for art because many will see that the Ai art is easier and neglect to see the worth in practicing and getting better at art. Services that pay artists so their users can create AI art are also part of the problem because huge art companies and animation studios are starting to lay off large amounts of their workers which could also scare upcoming artists from trying to become animators or artists in general. AI art has cons that outweigh it as a whole and detrimental to the art world. </p>
