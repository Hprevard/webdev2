          Welcome to Celestial Connections where we strive to be enlightened and seek
higher knowledge that brings us closer to the universe. Celestial Connections
was started by our leader Terra Jones. Raised in a christian church she started
to see her true purpose to lead and to study taboo and occult topics. After
studying tarot cards, astrology, runes and other subjects for 5 years she left the
church and started her own.
In our home in the beautiful wooded area of Crossett, Arkansas we have a
wonderful Lodge built by Terra and the other members just a few years ago and 
we all live wonderful lives here. Our days in our community include doing guided
meditations, tarot readings, astrology observations and readings. We also have
sound bowl meditations, reiki rituals and many more. Recording all of it so that
we can share and educate all of our followers.
Our mission is to guide those on their life path to achieve their higher purpose
and to stay aligned with their higher self. Using the resources we provide you
have the best available knowledge during your journey. We are well aware of the
misinformation that reigns heavily in the spiritual community which is why we
use information from peer reviewed sources and from spiritualists who have
spent many years on the topics.
