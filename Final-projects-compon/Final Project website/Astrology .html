       Astrology is a ancient study and practice on celestial bodies, their movements
and their influence on peoples lives. Astrology itself has existed through many
cultures for thousands of years. Most people have a lot of skepticism around the
validity of astrology and will simply name it a pseudoscience. To contrast most
people that genuinely understand astrology point out that it offers great insights
into people’s relationship’s, personalities, and their future. The possible evidence
for astrology wouldn’t align with the scientific standards most people were used
to. Proof of astrology can be contributed to the relevance and historical allure.
Astrology has played a huge role in shaping societies and people’s views. In
Nicholas Campion’s seminal work “The History of Western Astrology” he traces
the origins of Astrology to Mesopotamia and Egyptian civilizations where
celestial movement and signs were highly regarded. As astrology was integrated
        into many different cultures and countries the interest in it grew. </p>

        <p>Astrology mainly
resonates with people seeking self understanding and meaning in our confusing
world. Carl Jung, a psychologist, explained astrology using synchronicities.
Where he suggested that people experience coincidences between internal
psychological states and external events. In other studies Geoffrey Dean and
Ivan W. Kelly explained that astrology is the experience of countless believers to
confirm the psychological relevance in giving people comfort, guidance and a
sense of belonging.
Nowadays astrology has expanded to the modern era while retaining it’s core
principles. The internet and social media has given way to more and more
audiences to learn and experience astrology. This has caused many different
        astrology communities of those who love it and practice it.
          
Astrologers like
Susan Miller and Chani Nicholas have gained large amounts of recognition for
their predictions, forecasts for those seeking guidance. Despite criticism from
skeptics, astrology's popularity persists, with surveys indicating significant 
proportions of the population consulting horoscopes and astrological services.
Despite criticism, astrology remains popular.
In conclusion astrology does lack normal scientific evidence but it’s historical
impact and influence cannot be denied. Throughout everything, astrology still
gives meaning and insight to help people navigate through the hardships of life.
Whether viewed as relic of history or a tool for personal growth its a
phenomenon that reflects our fascination with the universe.
