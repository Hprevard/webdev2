          <p> My major is User Experience and my minor is in creative writing.  I have made websites using websites like wix and I'm interested in gaining more knowledge about it. After I graduate I hope to continue to learn and build skills in many different subjects so that I can have a portfolio to get a job where ever I want or what can pay me the most. </p>

          <p>My interests include analyzing movies. I love to write horror stories and I hope soon after I graduate I can write something to publish. I love to draw and design anything ( websites, clothes, jewelry) anything really. I have a lot of interests.  I also have my own business where I make jewelry but I am reseting and organizing priorities. </p>
